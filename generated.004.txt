<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>So  uh I'm suggesting we turn it around and - and uh sort of we have - anybody has some</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>the one th- one thing I  know  that we have on that is uh we had talked a - a couple weeks before um</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>um uh l- l- attempting to locate events,</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>uh interruptions with something  else  like some other noise.</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>uh areas that uh we're thinking about doing.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>uh and  one  of the things I know that  also  came up uh is some discussions that - that uh - that uh Jane had with Lokendra</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>Um, so, uh, he was interested in the question of - you know, relating to his - to the research he presented recently,</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>um of inference structures, and uh, the need to build in, um,</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>I looked through the transcript that we have so far,  and um, fou- identified a couple different types of things of that type and um,</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>"Well, should we restart the recording at this point?"</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>um, "ahead of the game" is sp- speaking with respect to space limitations, that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space, and that therefore we can keep the recording we've done so far.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>um we were trying to think of ways that  his  interests could interact with ours and um</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data,</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>in or- before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh, with Jane's help, look</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>into some of the data that we're - already  have</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>this is - gonna be a big, big problem if you want to  later  do uh, you know, indexing, or</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Right now I'm looking at  Jane  and talking, now I'm looking at  Chuck  and talking, I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference.</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>Then the issue of - of being able to trace Joe, because we know he's well-known in this field, and all this and - and tie it to the speaker,</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>whose name was just mentioned a moment ago, can be sensitive. So I think it's really - really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to because if there's a slanderous aspect to it, then how much to we wanna be able to have to remove?</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>audio and the written every time someone says a name.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>O_K. I - I remind that me - my first objective eh, in the project is to - to study difference parameters to - to find a - a good solution to detect eh, the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>And eh so eh I was eh - I am transcribing the - the first session and I - I have found eh, eh one thousand acoustic events,</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>I think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping events</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>How many overlaps were there uh in it?</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>Eh in twelve minutes I found eh, eh one thousand acoustic events.</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>With the overlapping zone, overlapping speech - speech what eh different duration.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>Does this - ? So if you had an overlap involving three people, how many times was that counted?</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>I - I - I con- I consider - I consider eh an acoustic event, the overlapping zone, the period where three speaker or eh - are talking together.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Eh at first eh, eh two talkers are uh, eh speaking,</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>and eh, eh a third person eh join to - to that.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together,</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>That's a lot of overlap, yeah, for forty-five minutes.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>um, for example, eh if eh we use the ehm - the mixed file, to - to transcribe,</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>It's right. But the problem is  the following.</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>the - the problem is eh, eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by - by that mike</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh  fet  mike,</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>I_B_M to do  word  level transcription, not speech event transcription.</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>So I agree that if someone wants to do  speech  event transcription, that</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>the initial eh segmentation</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap, it's probably better to use a distant mike. On the other hand,</a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>But  why  can't you use the  combination  of the close-talking mikes,  time  aligned?</a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>Although the  other  issue is that the  mixed close-talking mikes - I mean, I'm doing weird normalizations and things like that.</a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>But eh my idea is to - to process only  nnn, this eh - nnn, this kind of s- of eh speech.</a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>Well, not just the overlaps,  everything.</a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>So we weren't  concerned  with  exactly when an overlap started and stopped.</a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>No, of  course.  I expect you to find  more  overlaps than - than Jane because you're looking at it at a much more detailed level.</a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>but in the interests of making progress, uh might I s- how - how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps?</a>
<a name="49">[49]</a> <a href="#49" id=49>There's - there's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth, and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth and - and something in between with paper rustling.</a>
<a name="50">[50]</a> <a href="#50" id=50>Now, why do you need to mark speaker overlap by  hand  if you can infer it from the relative energy in the - I mean, you shouldn't  need  to do this p- completely by hand, right?</a>
<a name="51">[51]</a> <a href="#51" id=51>What I mean is  get it from the  close-talking  mikes.</a>
<a name="52">[52]</a> <a href="#52" id=52>um, that you can get the  training  data for pretty quickly is, you know, if you infer form the close-talking mikes where the on-off points are of speech, you know, how can we detect that from a far-field?</a>
<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53>And, it seems to work, I've - I'm sort of fiddling with the parameters,</a>
<a name="54">[54]</a> <a href="#54" id=54>and I haven't - I don't - what I'm working on -  was  working on - was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have,  into Transcriber.</a>
<a name="55">[55]</a> <a href="#55" id=55>give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like,</a>
<a name="56">[56]</a> <a href="#56" id=56>Well, it's definitely good to have somebody look at it. I was just thinking as a way to speed up</a>
<a name="57">[57]</a> <a href="#57" id=57>Another  thing we discussed was um that -</a>
<a name="58">[58]</a> <a href="#58" id=58>Um, I'd expect like there should be seventy-five overlaps. Did you find</a>
<a name="59">[59]</a> <a href="#59" id=59>uh  more  than seventy-five overlaps in that period, or - ?</a>
<a name="60">[60]</a> <a href="#60" id=60>That piece was then uh sent to I_B_M so  they  could transcribe so we have some comparison point.</a>
<a name="61">[61]</a> <a href="#61" id=61>uh put on C_D-ROM and sent uh to I_B_M.</a>
<a name="62">[62]</a> <a href="#62" id=62>That was about ten hours, and there was about -</a>
<a name="63">[63]</a> <a href="#63" id=63>uh, we've started having a morning meeting, today uh i- starting a w- a week or two ago, on the uh front-end issues, and we're recording those,</a>
<a name="64">[64]</a> <a href="#64" id=64>uh there's a network services and applications group here who's agreed to have their meetings recorded,</a>
<a name="65">[65]</a> <a href="#65" id=65>and we're gonna start recording them. They're - They meet on Tuesdays. We're gonna start recording them next week.</a>
<a name="66">[66]</a> <a href="#66" id=66>Actually that's something I wanted to ask, is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the  transcription  of the digits.</a>
<a name="67">[67]</a> <a href="#67" id=67>I - I would really like someone to do adaptation.  So if we got someone interested in that, I think it would be  great  for Meeting Recorder.</a>
<a name="68">[68]</a> <a href="#68" id=68>is to do block echo cancellation,</a>
<a name="69">[69]</a> <a href="#69" id=69>the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation because people move around,</a>
<a name="70">[70]</a> <a href="#70" id=70>Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly and so the tack that we've taken is more "lets come up with feature approaches and multi-stream approaches and so forth, that will be  robust  to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal".</a>
<a name="71">[71]</a> <a href="#71" id=71>But it occurred to me a few months ago that uh</a>
<a name="72">[72]</a> <a href="#72" id=72>good to sort of  test  them, actually. And so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and</a>
<a name="73">[73]</a> <a href="#73" id=73>that's something I'd like somebody to do at some point, just take these digits, take the far-field mike signal, and the close</a>
<a name="74">[74]</a> <a href="#74" id=74>uh mike signal, and apply really good echo cancellation. Um,</a>
<a name="75">[75]</a> <a href="#75" id=75>there was a - have been some nice talks recently by - by Lucent on - on their b-</a>
<a name="76">[76]</a> <a href="#76" id=76>the  block  echo cancellation particularly appealed to me, uh you know, trying and change it sample by sample, but you have some reasonable sized blocks.</a>
<a name="77">[77]</a> <a href="#77" id=77>uh with some constraints.</a>
<a name="78">[78]</a> <a href="#78" id=78>echo cancelling is - is, you know, commonly done in telephony,</a>
<a name="79">[79]</a> <a href="#79" id=79>some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me,</a>
<a name="80">[80]</a> <a href="#80" id=80>f- f- from the opposite dogma. Right? Which is what I was calling the "party line", which is that</a>
<a name="81">[81]</a> <a href="#81" id=81>uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want. We want something more flexible,</a>
<a name="82">[82]</a> <a href="#82" id=82>is corrupted so that it's decision about what the right -</a>
<a name="83">[83]</a> <a href="#83" id=83>um, concluded we didn't want to in- do inversion, and we're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation, which isn't really inversion,</a>
<a name="84">[84]</a> <a href="#84" id=84>and um we decided to do this approach of taking - uh, just picking</a>
<a name="85">[85]</a> <a href="#85" id=85>valid for a certain number of meetings.  She  wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form.</a>
<a name="86">[86]</a> <a href="#86" id=86>uh that - that is transcribed, we have - we have twelve hours that's recorded but not transcribed,</a>
<a name="87">[87]</a> <a href="#87" id=87>I was starting to think of some projects where you would use</a>
<a name="88">[88]</a> <a href="#88" id=88>energy detection on the close-talking mikes. There are a number of</a>
<a name="89">[89]</a> <a href="#89" id=89>interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting, that don't require any transcription. So what are the patterns, the energy patterns over the meeting?</a>
<a name="90">[90]</a> <a href="#90" id=90>and you can always think of, also for political reasons, if ICSI collected</a>
<a name="91">[91]</a> <a href="#91" id=91>Right? So, I th- I think that if we are able to keep that up</a>
<a name="92">[92]</a> <a href="#92" id=92>record,  especially  meetings that have some kind of conflict in them  or some kind of deci-</a>
<a name="93">[93]</a> <a href="#93" id=93>that uh there's uh - It - it oc- it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data</a>
<a name="94">[94]</a> <a href="#94" id=94>by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media.</a>
<a name="95">[95]</a> <a href="#95" id=95>Um and so I do think we're gonna continue recording here and record what we  can.</a>
<a name="96">[96]</a> <a href="#96" id=96>uh that we could invite them to have</a>
<a name="97">[97]</a> <a href="#97" id=97>in the - under this controlled situation we could at  least  collect, you know, thirty to fifty hours.</a>
<a name="98">[98]</a> <a href="#98" id=98>And at the rate we're going we'll get pretty  close  to that I think this semester.</a>
<a name="99">[99]</a> <a href="#99" id=99>And if we continue to collect some next semester, I think we should,</a>
<a name="100">[100]</a> <a href="#100" id=100>within say a month, you know, how much data do you have to work with. And you - you wanna s- you wanna sort of fr-  freeze  your - your data for  awhile</a>
<a name="101">[101]</a> <a href="#101" id=101>we  should  have at least something like, you know, twenty-five, thirty  hours.</a>
<a name="102">[102]</a> <a href="#102" id=102>uh  used  to dealing with multi-channel uh transcriptions. So I think that we'll need to adjust some - And also if we wanna add things like</a>
<a name="103">[103]</a> <a href="#103" id=103>um, well, more refined coding of overlaps, then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through.</a>
<a name="104">[104]</a> <a href="#104" id=104>I wanted to ask another a- a- aspect of the data collection.  There'd be no reason why a person couldn't get together several uh, you know, friends, and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to, right?</a>
<a name="105">[105]</a> <a href="#105" id=105>what we're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions, but I think if it's a real -</a>
<a name="106">[106]</a> <a href="#106" id=106>Stage some political debates.</a>
<a name="107">[107]</a> <a href="#107" id=107>politically  better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data,  especially  with the I_T_R, if we put in a proposal on it. It'll just look like ICSI's collected a lot more</a>
<a name="108">[108]</a> <a href="#108" id=108>audio  data. Um, whether it's transcribed or not</a>
<a name="109">[109]</a> <a href="#109" id=109>questions you can answer without the transcriptions, or at least that you can  start  to answer.</a>
<a name="110">[110]</a> <a href="#110" id=110>It seems like it's a big part of this corpus is to have the close-talking mikes.</a>
<a name="111">[111]</a> <a href="#111" id=111>by the way, I don't think the transcriptions are  actually,  in the  long  run, such a big bottleneck. I think the issue is just that we're - we're blazing that</a>
<a name="112">[112]</a> <a href="#112" id=112>d- Do you have any idea when - when uh the - you'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them?</a>
<a name="113">[113]</a> <a href="#113" id=113>Right. What about these lunch meetings - I mean, I don't know, if there's any way without too much more overhead, even if we don't ship it right away to I_B_M even if we just collect it here for awhile,  to record</a>
<a name="114">[114]</a> <a href="#114" id=114>didn't  happen,  but they were really intending to be duplicating this</a>
<a name="115">[115]</a> <a href="#115" id=115>two speech meetings, one uh network meeting,</a>
<a name="116">[116]</a> <a href="#116" id=116>One of the things that I think is a little - a  little  bit of a limitation, there is a think when the people are  not  involved uh in our work,</a>
<a name="117">[117]</a> <a href="#117" id=117>are  gonna feel a little bit constrained.</a>
<a name="118">[118]</a> <a href="#118" id=118>Now, it  might  get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time. And the - then - so then they can just really sort of try to - put the mikes on and then just charge in and - and -</a>
<a name="119">[119]</a> <a href="#119" id=119>w- um, I know that you don't want</a>
<a name="120">[120]</a> <a href="#120" id=120>So I - I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i- who are interested in speech recognition</a>
<a name="121">[121]</a> <a href="#121" id=121>we decided we're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings."</a>
<a name="122">[122]</a> <a href="#122" id=122>and uh - But if we ask them to  do  that they might be  intrigued  enough by the idea that they</a>
<a name="123">[123]</a> <a href="#123" id=123>Um. We're getting towards the end of our disk space, so we should think about trying to wrap up here.</a>
<a name="124">[124]</a> <a href="#124" id=124></a>
