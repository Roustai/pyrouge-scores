O_K. So we're gonna try to finish by five so people who want to can go hear Nancy Chang's talk,

some lines of code were already written today

That sounds good. Johno, are you gonna have some time t- to do that uh w- with these guys?
the - the ultimate goal is that before
they leave we - we can run through the entire system
continue either all through tonight or tomorrow on whatever
to get the er parser interface working.
Sort of one  branch  is to get us caught up on what's going on.
It probably will work better if we do it later in the week, after  we actually understand

so anyt- we'll find a time later in the week to uh get together and talk about   your  understanding of what SmartKom plans are.

And it breaks halfway through the experiment and a human operator comes on.
part of that is sort of trying to find out whether people change their linguistic verbal behavior when first thinking they speak to a machine and then to a human.
we have first looked at a simple sentence that

and so forth. There are all kinds of decisions that we have identified
And we are constructing - and then we've identified more or less the
extra-linguistic parameters that may f-
play a role. Information related to the user and information related to the situation.
And we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that

But we believe that we have laid out the fundamental decisions in this little space and the things that influence them.
So  one  of the decisions is what we call this A_V_E thing.
So that's a- a discrete decision. There are only three possibilities and the uh - what one would like is for this uh, knowledge modeling module to

That would get expressed and then hopefully

my suggestion then is that you um
look into the currently ongoing discussion about how the

of how dialogues would proceed.
Well uh Marcus  Lerkult  is actually implementing that

because um again in- in Deep Map we have faced and implemented those problems once already maybe we can even shuffle some know how from there to

Those are the - I think the - the true key issues is how does the whatever comes out of the language input pipeline look like and then what the action planner does with it -
and how that is uh specified.

uh the action planner
into all the analysis modules,
telling them what to expect and what the current state of the discourse is.
Beyond what's currently being implemented which is just word lists.
So anyway, Robert, that's why I was thinking that
And even on - on a more basic level the - the action planner

routes and whatever we are doing for the tourist.
I showed you once the interac- action between them among them in the deep map system so -
the action planner should not be - or the dialogue manager in that case should not um w- have to worry about whether it's interfacing with um something that does route planning in this way or that way huh, it j-
It's tricky because one could  well  imagine - I think it will turn  out  to be the case that

will fill in some parameters about what the person wants. One could  well  imagine
that the next thing that's trying to fill out the  detailed

And to run that back through

I totally agree. But - but what it nee- but th- what the point is the- in that case the  dialogue  manager is sort of  event  driven.
So the  dialogue  manager may think it's in a  dialogue   state
one of these  planning  modules comes along and says "hey,  right  now we need

So we  talked  about the  fact  that
a  certain  number of  decisions
that will be then fed to the  function  module,

So there are these decisions. And then
