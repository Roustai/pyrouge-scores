<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>how things are construed, and then the idea is to use ontology, situation, user, and</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model  to do some inferences in terms of what is being construed as  what</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>But, with a focus on  @@</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>And  any  type of comment whether it's a spelling or a syntax or</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>That's when I'm meeting with Wolfgang Wahlster to</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>Then I'm  also  going to present a little talk at E_M_L,</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>Then what have we done so far? We had our little bit of, um,</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>That's the -  not  the construction parser. That's the, uh, tablet-based parser, and</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>That's done. You have to change those strategies, right? That's, ten words?</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>And, um, and Fey is doing the synthesis stuff as we speak.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>talk a bit about the embodied and simulation approach favored here and as a prelude,</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>So X_schemas, then, I would like to do - talk about the construction aspect and then at the end about our Bayes-net.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>"Future activities" something.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>and that we're planning to  do  this, um,</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>anal- there - the - there - we've got various i- generations of slides that show language analysis, and matching to the underlying image schemas, and,</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>Kind of a different level of analysis.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Including cr- cross-bridges, and</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>constructions,  that, uh, Nancy and Keith and friends are doing,</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>to  metaphorical  cases and  metonymic  cases and all those things, requires this additional mechanism,</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>at - at the base level, it should com- uh, interact with all the metonymies and metaphors so that all of the projections of it also should work.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>uh, compose with all of the constructions.</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>these  base  constructs and then a general mechanism for coercing them.</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>idea of a source, path, and goal</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>you know as - as a obstacle, or as some physical object. So there are  multiple   construals.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>So it's a lot of pragmatics, there, that</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>of construal. So let's first do</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>So we're thinking about, um,</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>you know, despite the fact that this is  not  the most met- metaphorical domain, because people interacting with  H_T_I  systems try to be straightforward and less lyrical,</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>um, key in terms of finding out  any  of these things, so,</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>We, uh - I - with a - I looked - with a student I looked at the entire database that we have on Heidelberg for cases of metonymy.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>have then ask the system about the objects and engage in conversation on the history and the art and the architecture and so forth.</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>O_K. So why don't we plan to give you feedback electronically.</a>
