<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>Well eh you know that I work - I begin to work with a new feature to detect voice-unvoice.</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>eh bus- base system</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>No,  satly  the mes- the Mel Cepstrum, the new base system - the new base system.</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>one that only have t- three output,  voice, unvoice, and silence, and</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>And I put together the fifteen features and the three M_L_P output.</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>the - with the new code.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>um yeah one of the differences between voiced, unvoiced and silence is energy.</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>as additional inputs, rather than having a separate -</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>uh about the difference between the - the uh um</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>I - H- Hynek last week say that if I have time I can to begin to - to study</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>carefully what they are doing with the program  @@  and I begin to - to work also in that.</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>I think that Stephane will arrive today or tomorrow.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>uh to get a  feel  for things, a range of things, not just  speech.  Uh.</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>But I think for - for sort of dyed-in-the-wool speech people, um I think that I_C_S_L_P and Eurospeech are much more targeted.</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>progress, I - I've been getting a - getting my committee members for the quals.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>And um so far I have Morgan and Hynek,</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Then uh I talked a little bit about</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>um continuing with these dynamic ev- um acoustic events,</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>thinking about a way to test the completeness of</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>a - a set of um dynamic uh events.</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>do they provide sufficient coverage</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>for the phones that we're trying to recognize</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>a chosen set of features, or acoustic events,</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>um system to do  phone  recognition on  TIMIT.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>So i- i- the idea is if we get good phone recognition results,</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>using um these set of acoustic events,</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>um that - that says that these acoustic events are g- sufficient to cover</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>"are we on the right track with - with the -</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>uh working on my</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>Actually, let me - Hold that thought. Let me back up while we're still on it. The - the other thing I was suggesting, though, is that given that you're talking about binary features,</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>and uh count co-occurrences and get probabilities for a discrete H_M_M</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>it seems to me that the only reasonable starting point is</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>uh to automatically translate the uh</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>current TIMIT markings into the markings you want.</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>Yeah and a short - short amount of time, just to - again, just to see if that information is sufficient</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>to uh determine the phones.</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>to get an idea about</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>and hopefully there should be some point at which</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>Uh, you  could,  but the thing is, what he's talking about here is a uh - a translation to a per-frame feature vector,</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>um compare it with the results by um King and Taylor who did</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>a set of phonological features</a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>Um. So, support vector machines are - are good with dealing with a less amount of data</a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>and um so if you - if you give it less data it still does a reasonable job</a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>the - the  simple  idea behind a support vector machine is</a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>uh a  condensed  nearest-neighbor, where you would - you would - you would pick out uh some representative examples which would uh be sufficient to represent - to - to correctly classify everything that came in.</a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>if you have uh only a modest amount of data, you have trouble</a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>Uh s- So Barry, if you just have zero and ones, how are you doing the speech recognition?</a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>Oh! Uh I haven't gone through the entire table,  yet. Yeah, yesterday I brought Chuck</a>
<a name="49">[49]</a> <a href="#49" id=49>come up with the phones? or to come up with these vectors to see how closely they match the phones, or - ?</a>
<a name="50">[50]</a> <a href="#50" id=50>Right, um to come up with a mapping from um M_F_C_C's or s- some feature set,</a>
<a name="51">[51]</a> <a href="#51" id=51>it's - it's basically - it's - it's really simple, basically a detection</a>
<a name="52">[52]</a> <a href="#52" id=52>of phonological features.</a>
<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53>a mapping from M_F_C_C's to</a>
<a name="54">[54]</a> <a href="#54" id=54>then uh map that to phones. So I'm - I'm sort of reproducing phase one of their stuff.</a>
<a name="55">[55]</a> <a href="#55" id=55>changes to the data in comparing P_L_P and mel cepstrum</a>
<a name="56">[56]</a> <a href="#56" id=56>of a few percent</a>
<a name="57">[57]</a> <a href="#57" id=57>uh for P_L_P with the normalization done as it had been done for the mel cepstrum.</a>
<a name="58">[58]</a> <a href="#58" id=58>What I've been  doing  is</a>
<a name="59">[59]</a> <a href="#59" id=59>well it seems like there's a bug,</a>
<a name="60">[60]</a> <a href="#60" id=60>So what I was working on is um</a>
<a name="61">[61]</a> <a href="#61" id=61>there was just some kind of obvious bug in the way that I was computing the features.</a>
<a name="62">[62]</a> <a href="#62" id=62>uh difference in word error rate</a>
<a name="63">[63]</a> <a href="#63" id=63>I was looking - I've been studying and going through the logs for the system that um Andreas created.</a>
<a name="64">[64]</a> <a href="#64" id=64>S_R_ I  system looks like it  works  is that it reads the wavefiles  directly,</a>
<a name="65">[65]</a> <a href="#65" id=65>whereas with  our  features, he's actually storing</a>
<a name="66">[66]</a> <a href="#66" id=66>a front-end parameter file. Which talks about the kind of</a>
<a name="67">[67]</a> <a href="#67" id=67>I've been working with um</a>
<a name="68">[68]</a> <a href="#68" id=68>on his project and then I've been trying to track down this bug</a>
<a name="69">[69]</a> <a href="#69" id=69>So one thing that I  did  notice, yesterday I was studying the um -</a>
<a name="70">[70]</a> <a href="#70" id=70>the uh RASTA code</a>
<a name="71">[71]</a> <a href="#71" id=71>you know, "only process from</a>
<a name="72">[72]</a> <a href="#72" id=72>uh the  filters.</a>
<a name="73">[73]</a> <a href="#73" id=73>certain settings of the parameters when you compute P_L_P which would basically cause it to output</a>
<a name="74">[74]</a> <a href="#74" id=74>So that, in effect, what I could  do  is use our code but produce mel  cepstrum</a>
<a name="75">[75]</a> <a href="#75" id=75>from people at  some  point,</a>
<a name="76">[76]</a> <a href="#76" id=76>uh they got some better results with the triangular filters rather than the trapezoidal. So that  is  an option</a>
<a name="77">[77]</a> <a href="#77" id=77>One  of the things that I  did   notice  was that the um</a>
<a name="78">[78]</a> <a href="#78" id=78>you know, look at a few points to see where you are starting to get significant  search  errors.</a>
<a name="79">[79]</a> <a href="#79" id=79>Well, what I was gonna do is I was gonna take</a>
<a name="80">[80]</a> <a href="#80" id=80>if - if that looks  promising  you could, you know, r- uh run</a>
<a name="81">[81]</a> <a href="#81" id=81>the overall test set</a>
<a name="82">[82]</a> <a href="#82" id=82>And the uh the - the run time of the recognizer on the P_L_P features is longer</a>
<a name="83">[83]</a> <a href="#83" id=83>item that once we - once we had it going we would use for a number of the front-end things also.</a>
<a name="84">[84]</a> <a href="#84" id=84>tried this mean subtraction method. Um. Due to Avendano,</a>
<a name="85">[85]</a> <a href="#85" id=85>the error rate went from something like eighty</a>
<a name="86">[86]</a> <a href="#86" id=86>to um four percent.</a>
<a name="87">[87]</a> <a href="#87" id=87>actually a little  side  point is I  think  that's the first results that we have</a>
<a name="88">[88]</a> <a href="#88" id=88>on - on the far field  data</a>
<a name="89">[89]</a> <a href="#89" id=89>the S_R_I system on this</a>
<a name="90">[90]</a> <a href="#90" id=90>is  at some point just to take -</a>
<a name="91">[91]</a> <a href="#91" id=91>but there's  still  this kind of  ratio.  It's something like  five  percent error</a>
<a name="92">[92]</a> <a href="#92" id=92>with the - the distant mike, and one percent with the  close  mike.</a>
<a name="93">[93]</a> <a href="#93" id=93>uh a lot of Switchboard, Call Home,</a>
<a name="94">[94]</a> <a href="#94" id=94>it's reasonable to expect it would be helpful if we used it with the S_R_I system and</a>
<a name="95">[95]</a> <a href="#95" id=95>word error rate on digits is - uh digit strings is not</a>
<a name="96">[96]</a> <a href="#96" id=96></a>
