<a name="1">[1]</a> <a href="#1" id=1>a fierce argument that broke out over whose tiramisu might be the best and so we decided to have a contest where those people who</a>
<a name="2">[2]</a> <a href="#2" id=2>So. On Friday we had our wizard test data test</a>
<a name="3">[3]</a> <a href="#3" id=3>serve as the first subject. So, this is what she  saw  as part of - as uh for instr- introduction, this is what she had to  read</a>
<a name="4">[4]</a> <a href="#4" id=4>The names and um</a>
<a name="5">[5]</a> <a href="#5" id=5>uh I should say the system was  supposed  to break down and then um these were the remaining three tasks that she was going to  solve,  with a  human  -</a>
<a name="6">[6]</a> <a href="#6" id=6>There are -  here  are uh the results.</a>
<a name="7">[7]</a> <a href="#7" id=7>The  reading  was five minutes, exactly. And now comes the - This is the phone-in phase of -</a>
<a name="8">[8]</a> <a href="#8" id=8>I thought it was a recording.  @@  At first I thought it was like a recording that could pick up what you're saying and give you directions.</a>
<a name="9">[9]</a> <a href="#9" id=9>Um. We need to - So that's one thing. And we need a better introduction for the wizard. That is something that Fey actually thought of a - in the last second that sh- the system should introduce  itself,  when it's called.</a>
<a name="10">[10]</a> <a href="#10" id=10>And um, um, another suggestion, by  Liz,  was that we uh, through subjects, switch the tasks. So when - when they have task-one with the computer, the next person should have task-one with a human, and so forth. So we get nice um data for that.</a>
<a name="11">[11]</a> <a href="#11" id=11>Um, we have to refine the tasks more and more, which of course we haven't done at all, so far,</a>
<a name="12">[12]</a> <a href="#12" id=12>So  first of all, I agree that um we should hire Fey, and start paying her. Probably pay for the time she's put in as well.</a>
<a name="13">[13]</a> <a href="#13" id=13>Um, do you know exactly how to do that, or is uh Lila - I mean, you know what exactly do we do to - to put her on the payroll in some way?</a>
<a name="14">[14]</a> <a href="#14" id=14>more thoroughly, this is the information on - on the low- sunken castle, and the amphitheater that never came up,</a>
<a name="15">[15]</a> <a href="#15" id=15>And um I told her that we gonna um figure out a meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and s- look for the potential sources to find people.</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a> <a href="#16" id=16>However, we may run into a problem with a  reading  task there.</a>
<a name="17">[17]</a> <a href="#17" id=17>Yeah. We could talk to the people who run it and um see if they have a way that they could easily uh tell people that there's a task, pays ten bucks or something, but</a>
<a name="18">[18]</a> <a href="#18" id=18>Now,  I signed us up for the Wednesday slot,</a>
<a name="19">[19]</a> <a href="#19" id=19>my idea on that was</a>
<a name="20">[20]</a> <a href="#20" id=20>in some of this issue about what the  task  is and</a>
<a name="21">[21]</a> <a href="#21" id=21>all - um you know, what the  dialogue  is, and what's going on  linguistically,</a>
<a name="22">[22]</a> <a href="#22" id=22>um give the  computer  scientists some idea of - of</a>
<a name="23">[23]</a> <a href="#23" id=23>what's going on with the  system  design, and where we think the  belief-nets  fit in and where the  pieces  are and stuff like that.</a>
<a name="24">[24]</a> <a href="#24" id=24>and we also have a l- little bit on the interface, M_-three-L_ enhancement, and then um that was  it,  I think.</a>
<a name="25">[25]</a> <a href="#25" id=25>So, what I did for this - this is - uh, a pedagogical belief-net because</a>
<a name="26">[26]</a> <a href="#26" id=26>conceptually do what you were talking about with the nodes that you could expand out - so what I did was I took - I made these dummy nodes called Trajector-In and Trajector-Out that</a>
<a name="27">[27]</a> <a href="#27" id=27>would isolate the things related to the trajector. And then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal.</a>
<a name="28">[28]</a> <a href="#28" id=28>And I separated them out. And then I um did similar things for our - our net to - uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot,</a>
<a name="29">[29]</a> <a href="#29" id=29>um, so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the - the  top  layer.</a>
<a name="30">[30]</a> <a href="#30" id=30>And then the bottom layer is just the Mode.</a>
<a name="31">[31]</a> <a href="#31" id=31>Yeah, there's just one more node and it says "Mode" which is the decision between the -</a>
<a name="32">[32]</a> <a href="#32" id=32>uh  image  schemas that would be related. And the two that I came up with</a>
<a name="33">[33]</a> <a href="#33" id=33>were Trajector-landmark and then Source-path-goal as initial ones.</a>
<a name="34">[34]</a> <a href="#34" id=34>or the "landmark-iness" of where I'm  currently  at. And "usefulness" is basi- basically means is that an institutional facility like a town hall or something like that that's not -</a>
<a name="35">[35]</a> <a href="#35" id=35>Similar things as the  source  except they also added whether the entity was closed and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination.</a>
<a name="36">[36]</a> <a href="#36" id=36>in terms of Context, what we had currently said was</a>
<a name="37">[37]</a> <a href="#37" id=37>Um, Discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee, or something along those lines.</a>
<a name="38">[38]</a> <a href="#38" id=38>Oh,  O_K . So, so if you - if we made - if we wanted to make it into a - a real uh Bayes-net,</a>
<a name="39">[39]</a> <a href="#39" id=39>and connect these things directly to the Mode.</a>
<a name="40">[40]</a> <a href="#40" id=40>Uh. Let me just mention something that I  don't  want to pursue today which is</a>
<a name="41">[41]</a> <a href="#41" id=41>So it's possible that we could do something like a summary node of some sort that -</a>
<a name="42">[42]</a> <a href="#42" id=42>So what I was gonna  say  is - is maybe a good at this point</a>
<a name="43">[43]</a> <a href="#43" id=43>but to try to  informally  think about what the decision variables  are.</a>
<a name="44">[44]</a> <a href="#44" id=44>So, if you have some bottom line</a>
<a name="45">[45]</a> <a href="#45" id=45>uh decision about which  mode,</a>
<a name="46">[46]</a> <a href="#46" id=46>And the  other  trick, which is not a  technical  trick, it's kind of a  knowledge  engineering trick,</a>
<a name="47">[47]</a> <a href="#47" id=47>is to make the n-  each node sufficiently narrow</a>
<a name="48">[48]</a> <a href="#48" id=48>that if you decided</a>
<a name="49">[49]</a> <a href="#49" id=49>given  that we're not gonna screw with the</a>
<a name="50">[50]</a> <a href="#50" id=50>uh on Wednesday are going to be able to -</a>
<a name="51">[51]</a> <a href="#51" id=51>clearly have to be specified m- more carefully and uh</a>
<a name="52">[52]</a> <a href="#52" id=52>and uh see if we can</a>
<a name="53">[53]</a> <a href="#53" id=53>we regard this as sort of an exercise in -</a>
<a name="54">[54]</a> <a href="#54" id=54>that you can give input and it- it'll uh throw the dice for you,</a>
<a name="55">[55]</a> <a href="#55" id=55>I integrated this into the  existing  SmartKom system in - in the same way as</a>
<a name="56">[56]</a> <a href="#56" id=56>will  look  like and what it'll  give  us,</a>
<a name="57">[57]</a> <a href="#57" id=57>and it will give us then of course an action type of the type "Enter".</a>
<a name="58">[58]</a> <a href="#58" id=58>"O_K, if it's  this  and  this  but  that  is not the case", and so forth, it just gets really really messy.</a>
<a name="59">[59]</a> <a href="#59" id=59>object types and stuff,</a>
<a name="60">[60]</a> <a href="#60" id=60>is add some rules  of the style that are already  there  that say</a>
<a name="61">[61]</a> <a href="#61" id=61>the existing SmartKom system.</a>
<a name="62">[62]</a> <a href="#62" id=62>then you can get the types from the  ontology,</a>
<a name="63">[63]</a> <a href="#63" id=63>uh interface and we have</a>
<a name="64">[64]</a> <a href="#64" id=64>the rules that are as banal as  of  we just saw, and we have our content. Now, the content -</a>
<a name="65">[65]</a> <a href="#65" id=65>I - whi- which is sort of what - what we see  here,  which is sort of the Vista, Schema, Source, Path, Goal, whatever. This will</a>
<a name="66">[66]</a> <a href="#66" id=66>Image schema, X_schema, constructions, in some - some form,</a>
<a name="67">[67]</a> <a href="#67" id=67>And the  rules  we want to throw away  completely.</a>
<a name="68">[68]</a> <a href="#68" id=68>And um - and here is exactly where what's gonna be replaced with our Bayes-net, which is exactly getting the input feeding into here.  This  decides</a>
<a name="69">[69]</a> <a href="#69" id=69>whether it's an- whether action - the - the Enter, the Vista,</a>
<a name="70">[70]</a> <a href="#70" id=70>Approach um construction should be activated,</a>
<a name="71">[71]</a> <a href="#71" id=71>So the immediate problem is just deciding w-</a>
<a name="72">[72]</a> <a href="#72" id=72>Aspects of the X_schema to add.</a>
<a name="73">[73]</a> <a href="#73" id=73>Yeah, so the pro- The  immediate  problem is - is back t- t- to what you were - what you are doing with the belief-net. You know,</a>
<a name="74">[74]</a> <a href="#74" id=74>what the person says and the context and the ontology.</a>
<a name="75">[75]</a> <a href="#75" id=75>So, I think that's the hardest problem at the moment is - is</a>
<a name="76">[76]</a> <a href="#76" id=76>Um, and that's - so, getting back to here, uh, we have a d- a technical problem with the belief-nets that we - we</a>
<a name="77">[77]</a> <a href="#77" id=77>So we wanna think about which ones we really care about</a>
<a name="78">[78]</a> <a href="#78" id=78>So instead of in- instead it should really be - just be "intention" as a node instead of "intention business" or "intention tour".</a>
<a name="79">[79]</a> <a href="#79" id=79>the probabilities of</a>
<a name="80">[80]</a> <a href="#80" id=80>Also it strikes me that we - we m- may want to approach the point where we can sort of try to find a -</a>
<a name="81">[81]</a> <a href="#81" id=81>uh, a specification for some interface, here that um</a>
<a name="82">[82]</a> <a href="#82" id=82>takes the normal M_-three-L_, looks at it. Then we discussed in our pre-edu - E_D_U meeting um how to ask the ontology, what to ask the ontology</a>
<a name="83">[83]</a> <a href="#83" id=83>and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology and we want to look up some more stuff</a>
<a name="84">[84]</a> <a href="#84" id=84>look up in the dialogue history um some s- some stuff. Based on we - we have uh - I was just made some examples from the ontology</a>
<a name="85">[85]</a> <a href="#85" id=85>and we get relations out of it and once we  have  them, we can use  that  information to look in the dialogue history, "were any of  these  things that - that are part of the town hall as an  institution  mentioned?", "were any of these that make the town hall a  building  mentioned?",</a>
<a name="86">[86]</a> <a href="#86" id=86>There  will  be  rules,  but they aren't rules that come to final  decisions,  they're rules that gather information for a decision process.</a>
<a name="87">[87]</a> <a href="#87" id=87>a thread or process or something that "Agent",</a>
<a name="88">[88]</a> <a href="#88" id=88>I think we - I - I can come up with a - a code for a module that we call the "cognitive dispatcher",</a>
<a name="89">[89]</a> <a href="#89" id=89>which does nothing, but it looks  of complect  object trees and decides how - are there parts missing that need to be filled out, there's - this is maybe something that this module can do, something that this module can do and then collect</a>
<a name="90">[90]</a> <a href="#90" id=90>uh sub-objects and then</a>
<a name="91">[91]</a> <a href="#91" id=91>is the fact that w- if you know about source - source,  paths   and goals, and nnn  all this sort of stuff,</a>
<a name="92">[92]</a> <a href="#92" id=92>Could be. I'm not a - I'm not op- particularly opposed to adding that or any other task, I mean, eventually we're gonna want a whole range of them.</a>
<a name="93">[93]</a> <a href="#93" id=93>The Bayes-nets will be dec- specific for each decision. But what I'd like to be able to do</a>
<a name="94">[94]</a> <a href="#94" id=94>that will go into different Bayes-nets, be</a>
<a name="95">[95]</a> <a href="#95" id=95>So that if you have sources, you have trajectors and stuff like that, and there's a language for  talking  about trajectors,</a>
<a name="96">[96]</a> <a href="#96" id=96>So all sorts of different tasks</a>
<a name="97">[97]</a> <a href="#97" id=97>and all sorts of different ways of  expressing  them use a lot of the same mechanism for pulling out what are the fundamental things going  on.</a>
<a name="98">[98]</a> <a href="#98" id=98>pushing it one step further, when you get to construction grammar and stuff, what you'd like to be able to do is say you have this  parser  which is much fancier than the parser that comes with</a>
<a name="99">[99]</a> <a href="#99" id=99>uh SmartKom, i- that - that actually  uses  constructions and is able to tell  from  this  construction</a>
<a name="100">[100]</a> <a href="#100" id=100>that you could tell  from  the construction, you could pull out deep semantic information which you're gonna use in a general  way.</a>
<a name="101">[101]</a> <a href="#101" id=101>It's unfortunate also that English has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs</a>
<a name="102">[102]</a> <a href="#102" id=102>to bring this, and assume that something may come  up  that we wanna look at.</a>
